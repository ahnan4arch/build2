    //
    // Note that for this mode to function properly we have to use fake

    // filesystem. The same is required for "logical clean" (i.e., dry-run
    // 'clean update' in order to see all the command lines).
    //
    // At first, it may seem like we should also "dry-run" changes to depdb.

    // we print might not be runnable (think of the compilation database).

    // be older than the target which in our model is treated as an
    // interrupted update (see depdb for details).
    //
    // Note also that sometimes it makes sense to do a bit more than
    // absolutely necessary or to discard information in order to keep the
    // rule logic sane.  And some rules may choose to ignore this flag
    // altogether. In this case, however, the rule should be careful not to

    // execute  - execute the matched rule
    //
    // The build system starts with a "serial load" phase and then continues
    // with parallel match and execute. Match, however, can be interrupted
    // both with load and execute.
    //
    // Match can be interrupted with "exclusive load" in order to load
    // additional buildfiles. Similarly, it can be interrupted with (parallel)
    // execute in order to build targetd required to complete the match (for
    // example, generated source code or source code generators themselves).
    //
    // Such interruptions are performed by phase change that is protected by

    // between phases).
    //
    // Serial load can perform arbitrary changes to the build state. Exclusive
    // load, however, can only perform "island appends". That is, it can
    // create new "nodes" (variables, scopes, etc) but not (semantically)
    // change already existing nodes or invalidate any references to such (the
    // idea here is that one should be able to load additional buildfiles as
    // long as they don't interfere with the existing build state). The
    // "islands" are identified by the load_generation number (0 for the
    // initial/serial load). It is incremented in case of a phase switch and
    // can be stored in various "nodes" to verify modifications are only done
    // "within the islands".

    // A "tri-mutex" that keeps all the threads in one of the three phases.
    // When a thread wants to switch a phase, it has to wait for all the other
    // threads to do the same (or release their phase locks). The load phase
    // is exclusive.
    //
    // The interleaving match and execute is interesting: during match we read
    // the "external state" (e.g., filesystem entries, modifications times,
    // etc) and capture it in the "internal state" (our dependency graph).
    // During execute we are modifying the external state with controlled
    // modifications of the internal state to reflect the changes (e.g.,
    // update mtimes). If you think about it, it's pretty clear that we cannot
    // safely perform both of these actions simultaneously. A good example
    // would be running a code generator and header dependency extraction
    // simultaneously: the extraction process may pick up headers as they are
    // being generated. As a result, we either have everyone treat the
    // external state as read-only or write-only.
    //
    // There is also one more complication: if we are returning from a load
    // phase that has failed, then the build state could be seriously messed
    // up (things like scopes not being setup completely, etc). And once we
    // release the lock, other threads that are waiting will start relying on
    // this messed up state. So a load phase can mark the phase_mutex as
    // failed in which case all currently blocked and future lock()/relock()
    // calls return false. Note that in this case we still switch to the

  // Here is what's going on here:
  //
  // 1. We first get a phase lock "for ourselves" since after the first
  //    iteration of the loop, things may become asynchronous (including
  //    attempts to switch the phase and modify the structure we are iteration
  //    upon).
  //
  // 2. The task can be queued or it can be executed synchronously inside
  //    async() (refer to the scheduler class for details on this semantics).
  //
  //    If this is an async()-synchronous execution, then the task will create
  //    a referencing phase_lock. If, however, this is a queued execution
  //    (including wait()-synchronous), then the task will create a top-level
  //    phase_lock.
  //
  //    Note that we only acquire the lock once the task starts executing
  //    (there is no reason to hold the lock while the task is sitting in the
  //    queue). This optimization assumes that whatever else we pass to the
  //    task (for example, a reference to a target) is stable (in other words,
  //    such a reference cannot become invalid).
  //
  // 3. Before calling wait(), we release our phase lock to allow switching
  //    the phase.
